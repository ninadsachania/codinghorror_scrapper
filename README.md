# codinghorror_scrapper

**Abstract:** The blog [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com) does not have an index or an archive of the blog posts over the years. This little scrapper script goes through each of the 285 pages and extracts the titles, links, and dates of all the blog posts on that page, and then outputs them to a HTML file. 

**How to use:** Open _blogarchive.md_.
